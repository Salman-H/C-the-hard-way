This bit of source is entirely just an exercise, and demonstrates how 
some math works. At the end, it also demonstrates something you see in C, 
but not in many other languages. To C, a "character" is just an integer. 
It's a really small integer, but that's all it is. This means you can do math 
on them, and a lot of software does just that, for good or bad.

This last bit is your first glance at how C gives you DIRECT ACCESS TO THE
MACHINE. We'll be exploring that more in later exercises.
