Keep the Makefile around since it'll help you spot errors and we'll be adding 
to it when we need to automate more things.

For Makefiles, use the following command to verify indents:

cat -e -t -v  Makefile

where 'Makefile' is the name of the Makefile (in this case they're same!)

To clean, commpile and run your program

$ make clean
$ make ex1
$ ./ex1
